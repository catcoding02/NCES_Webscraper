# NCES_Webscraper
Utilizing public data from the National Center for Education Statistics, this web scraper takes a district's NCES District ID, and, by scraping the number of students eligible for free and reduced lunch and the total enrollment for each school in the district, calculates percent of schools in the district that meet or exceed 70% of their students eligible for free and reduced lunch. This threshold is used by a national educational nonprofit to determine high-priority districts for supplies and other resource aid.
